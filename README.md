   - Identifying correlations and patterns within datasets.

### 3. **Model Building:**
   - Implementation of supervised learning models.
   - Exploration of algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal model performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Employing cross-validation techniques for robust model assessment.
   - Utilizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 5. **Deployment Concepts:**
   - Introduction to deploying machine learning models.
   - Basic integration with web applications.
